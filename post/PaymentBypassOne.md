# The Bug That Kept On Giving :: PaymentBypass :: QR CODE

## How we got there

A story of a bug i found through QR code Response Manipulation.

I was scrolling my [twitter](https://twitter.com/crypt0g30rgy) feed when i can across a [tweet](https://twitter.com/intigriti/status/1467111453945733139) from [@intigriti](https://twitter.com/intigriti) about paywall bypass, and i remembered i had a target that had payment bypass inscope.

I went a head and visted the program jij0 [(why)](/post/why). jij0 had a website offering an option to buy e-giftcards. <https://jij0.be/nl/jij0-gift> that would redirect you to <https://gifts.jij0.be>
This process contains a flow like;
> select gift card -> get taken to cart -> fill in all the details -> Verify info -> Select payment (By QR Code) -> get qr code -> scan qr to pay (Vulnerable area)

## Reproduction steps

1. Visit <https://gifts.jij0.be>
2. Select a gift card
3. get taken to cart -> fill in all the details -> Verify info -> Select payment (QR code) -> get qr code -> scan qr to payment
4. Open burp and intercept request with the payment info `"POST /rest/Payment/v1/status?"` and json data `{"paymentData": "DATAAAA"}`
5. Select burps do intercept response option.
6. Intercept response which should contain a json parmeter with `{"payload": "","resultCode":"pending","type":"complete"}
.Change the response from {"payload": "","resultCode":"pending","type":"complete"}` to `{"payload": "","resultCode":"complete","type":"complete"}`
7. Now you should recieve a green check to show payment complete and get redirected to
8. After several minutes you should recieve email confirmation of your purchase.

I made a report and sent it to the program and after a few days it got accepted as a high severity and Bounty â‚¬500 awarded.
