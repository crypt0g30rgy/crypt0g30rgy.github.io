# Auth Bypass Via Exposed Credentials

## How we got there

So it was on one of those days, i was feeling bored and kinda alone. When i feel like this i usually divulge into some hacking `(to fill that voidðŸ˜ƒ)`
So off i went to [Intigriti](https://app.intigriti.com/researcher) and i saw that a program i followed had an update `(funny story was i didn't recall having followed the program but i may have as well did, i get forgetful sometimes)`

After checking out the program lets call it jij0 [why](/post/why), i found that they had *.jij0.me on scope and they were rewarding bounties for it, upto â‚¬1500 for an exceptional bug.

So i said why not, up to this point the highest severity i ever got for my bug was high `(3 times)` via payment bypass `(Write-ups below)` or [Home](/).  

So after i took the domain i headed to [c99 Subdomain finder](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/index.php), pasted the domain and clicked start scan `(No other tool you ask[still bored remember])`. Found several hundred domains.

Now i visted all the domains one by one i eventually got to a domain chat.jij0.me that redirected to microsoft online sso. But during the redirect it loaded the javascript files as most common JavaScript Frameworks connecting to a nodejs backend. Like the [PHP EAR Vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Execution_After_Redirect_(EAR))

I stopped the redirect to microsoft online sso by doing a view-source:<https://chat.jij0.me>. Found the main js file that was under <https://chat.jij0.me/js/index.js>

Since i new the backend was written under NODEJS i started searching for the NODE_ENV variable. I saw that it had refrence like the following

```javascript
{NODE_ENV:"production",VUE_APP_ADMIN_URL:"https://ADMIN.JIJ0.ME",VUE_APP_VLS_BASIC_AUTH:"Basic Y2hhdG1ldXA6b250d2l0dGVyMHgwMSEK",VUE_APP_ENV:"PROD",VUE_APP_USEBOUNCER_API_KEY:"AKGjgdkgailgilutyuiqwkJGIKGiwegyw0",VUE_APP_VERSION:"1.33.7",BASE_URL:"/"}
```

After seing this i remember visiting <https://admin.jij0.me> which resulted in a 401 unauthorized error. To test the validity of the auth basic creds i requested the <https://admin.jij0.me/favicon.ico> which had previously returned a 401 error and this time i got a 200 OK

Sent the below request with burp.
```bash
GET /favicon.ico
HOST: admin.jij0.me
Authorization: Basic Y2hhdG1ldXA6b250d2l0dGVyMHgwMSEK
```

I was in and i could see so much information that was clearly not intended for the public. I felt good but was honestly scared a little, that feeling of getting a critical severity bug + being inside a government server was overwhelming at first.

>I immediately stopped testing and wrote a report including sceenshots and embedded the vulnerable code snipplet on my report.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Headed to <https://chat.jij0.me/js/index.js>
2. Searched and found the NODE_ENV values
3. Visited <https://admin.jij0.me> to see 401 error
4. Now add the creds chatmeup:ontwitter0x01! with chatmeup as the username & ontwitter0x01! the password
6. Now i have access to a lot of data data
7. I stopped testing at this point. But i believed an attacker can leverage this to escalate further.

## Report

After i found this bug i was super excited and shaking a little because i was in a goverment server viewing so much data.

`
I had access to internal communications that exposed sensitive information.
`

So i wrote up a detailed report fast and sent it to the program at intigriti. The report was triaged within 45 mins.

After waiting for two days i recieved a â‚¬700 bounty.
