If you are here it means you found my `not so delicate` easter egg.

if you read one/most of my posts you will have realized that i use the domains *.jij0.me and jij0 as a programme name, this is because of nda issues and some bugs not being fixed so i wouldn't wanna throw the program under the fire `of bug hunters` and putting myself on the crossfire.

Jij0 is a nickname i was given by a very close best friend of mine. Since then i prefer to use it as a domain in my blogs to avoid unecessary complications.

`(Special thanks sharryðŸ’• for the sweet nickname ðŸ˜‡)`
